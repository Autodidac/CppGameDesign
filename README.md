Yes, C++20 is excellent for game development! It brings several new features and improvements that enhance both performance and developer productivity, making it a compelling choice for modern game engines and applications. Hereâ€™s why C++20 is well-suited for games:

1. Performance Improvements
Concepts: Concepts allow for better compile-time checks and more readable code by defining constraints on template parameters. This can help in optimizing templates and reducing the compilation time, which is particularly useful in large game projects.
Ranges: The Ranges library provides a new way to work with collections and algorithms in a more readable and composable manner, which can simplify code and make it easier to reason about performance characteristics.
Coroutines: Coroutines in C++20 provide a powerful abstraction for writing asynchronous code, which is essential for game loops, networking, AI behaviors, and other real-time tasks. They help in writing more readable and maintainable code for asynchronous operations without the overhead of traditional thread management.
2. Modern Language Features
Modules: Modules help in improving build times by replacing the traditional header file inclusion model with a more efficient binary module interface. This can significantly reduce compilation times in large codebases typical of game development.
Constexpr Improvements: C++20 expands the capabilities of constexpr functions, allowing more complex computations at compile time. This can be used to precompute data and reduce runtime overhead, which is critical in performance-sensitive game applications.
Three-way Comparison (Spaceship Operator <=>): The three-way comparison operator simplifies code that involves complex comparisons and ordering, making it easier to write concise and correct comparison logic, which is often required in game engines for sorting and organizing objects.
3. Better Expressiveness and Safety
Concepts and Constraints: Concepts allow for more readable and safer templates by specifying constraints. This can reduce errors and improve code readability, especially in template-heavy codebases like game engines.
Enhanced constexpr and constinit: More flexible constexpr and the introduction of constinit ensure safer initialization of variables and prevent subtle bugs related to uninitialized or misinitialized variables.
std::span: std::span provides a safer, more efficient way to handle array views and memory blocks, which are common in game development for representing slices of data.
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
C++ is a highly portable language with support across all major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, consoles, etc.), and C++20 continues this tradition with no changes that would adversely affect cross-platform compatibility.
New features like coroutines and modules are designed with portability in mind, which helps in maintaining a single codebase for games that target multiple platforms.
5. Community and Ecosystem Support
C++ is one of the most widely used languages in game development, and C++20 is the latest iteration that many modern engines (like Unreal Engine, Unity with its native plugins, Godot with GDNative, etc.) and libraries are moving towards supporting. This ensures ongoing support, tutorials, libraries, and frameworks compatible with the latest C++ standards.
6. Leveraging Existing Ecosystem
Many popular game development libraries, such as glm (math library), Bullet (physics engine), STB (image loading), and Dear ImGui (GUI library), are fully compatible with C++20, allowing developers to use the latest language features with these established libraries.
C++20 also works seamlessly with modern build systems like CMake, which further simplifies cross-platform builds and dependency management.
Conclusion
C++20 offers a robust set of tools and features that cater well to game development. The performance enhancements, improved language features, and new tools like coroutines and modules make C++20 a great choice for building modern, efficient, and scalable games. The focus on performance, safety, and expressiveness allows developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code without sacrificing the low-level control needed for high-performance applications like games.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that while C++20 provides many advantages, it also introduces new complexities and requires up-to-date compilers and toolchains. Adopting C++20 should be weighed against the development team's familiarity with the new features and the available tooling and libraries. Overall, C++20 is an excellent choice for game development, offering a modern and efficient path forward.
